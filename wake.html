   <p> Synopsis: Part graphic novel, part memoir, Wake is an imaginative 
    tour-de-force that tells the story of women-led slave revolts and chronicles 
    scholar Rebecca Hall’s efforts to uncover the truth about these women warriors
    who, until now, have been left off the historical record. Women warriors planned 
    and led slave revolts on slave ships during the Middle Passage. They fought their 
    enslavers throughout the Americas. And then they were erased from history. Wake 
    tells the story of Dr. Rebecca Hall, a historian, granddaughter of slaves, and 
    a woman haunted by the legacy of slavery. The accepted history of slave revolts h
    as always told her that enslaved women took a back seat. But Rebecca decides to l
    ook deeper, and her journey takes her through old court records, slave ship captain’s 
    logs, crumbling correspondence, and even the forensic evidence from the bones of enslaved 
    women from the “negro burying ground” uncovered in Manhattan. She finds women warriors 
    everywhere. Using in-depth archival research and a measured use of historical imagination, 
    Rebecca constructs the likely pasts of Adono and Alele, women rebels who fought for freedom 
    during the Middle Passage, as well as the stories of women who led slave revolts in Colonial 
    New York. We also follow Rebecca’s own story as the legacy of slavery shapes life, both during 
    her time as a successful attorney and later as a historian seeking the past that haunts her. 
    Illustrated beautifully in black and white, Wake will take its place alongside classics of the 
    graphic novel genre, like Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis and Art Spiegelman’s Maus. The story of 
    both a personal and national legacy, it is a powerful reminder that while the past is gone, we 
    still live in its wake.
